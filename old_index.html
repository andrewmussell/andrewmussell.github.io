	<p>Hello, my name is Andrew Mussell. I am an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science student with a minor in Bioengineering at UC Berkeley. I have always been interested in advancing technology ever since I was an elementary school student spending my free time sketching invention ideas for electrical, mechanical, and robotics designs.
	I strive to work on projects that make a real, positive, and perceivable impact on the lives of those who interact with them. My project experience includes a smartwatch device capable of detecting falls and nearby hazardous conditions. The device also provides relevant data analytics to the user from various onboard sensors. Additionally, I work on developing performance electric vehicles with Formula Electric at Berkeley. I am the Low and High Voltage Electronics Lead and some of my experience includes Component Selection, Schematic Capture, and PCB Layout. I assist in the development of almost every custom Printed Circuit Board on the vehicle from power distribution to data acquisition and safety monitoring. I would like to continue this work with similar projects in the industry that are improving the standard of living and benefitting humanity.
